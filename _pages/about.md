Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Maria, Маша, Maruška, ~~Mariia~~\*

I'm a :sparkles: fourth :sparkles: year PhD student in General Linguistics at <a href='https://ling.ff.cuni.cz/en/'>Charles University</a> and a visiting researcher at <a href='https://www.slawistik.hu-berlin.de/en/home'>Humboldt University of Berlin</a>. I explore semantics and pragmatics of polar questions with the main focus on Russian, Czech and other Slavic languages. My research is a part of the [QueSlav project](https://www.radeksimik.eu/minilab.html). I work with theoretical, corpus-based, and experimental methods, and have recently become increasingly interested in computational approaches to language. The person who navigates me through my studies (aka my advisor) is [Radek Šimík](https://www.radeksimik.eu/personalia.html).     

From August 2024 to October 2026, I'll be in Berlin thanks to a [DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/) scholarship and the [CRC 1412 Register fellowship](https://sfb1412.hu-berlin.de/) :v:

\**Mariia* is an 'official' spelling of my name on legal documents (diplomas, passport and so on). I don't like it whatsoever, so I use *Maria* in publications. More about transliteration [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian#Transliteration_of_names_on_Russian_passports).
